# 100 Days of Swift

This repo is for documenting my jouney with [HackingWithSwift's roadmap](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) with Swift and UIKit. 

Every day I write down a couple of interesting features/facts/tips/tricks in iOS Dev that I come accross during these 100 days. I call them "Highlights" and you can find them [here](highlights.md).
